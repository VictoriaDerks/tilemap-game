Credit where credit is due

However highly (or lowly) you may think of me, I did not create all the assets that are used in this program.
Nor all the code. Please find a full list of credits down here.

Tilesets
* Tileset for the snow landscape: separate tilesets created by me from image found here: https://fanart.pokefans.net/tutorials/mapping/tilesets.
* Tileset for the grass landscape: tiles are from Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen. Separate tilesets created by me from image found here: https://www.deviantart.com/ozotwo/art/Pokemon-Tileset-Fire-Red-Leaf-Green-Outdoors-C-446156842

Sprites
* Player sprites were custom-drawn by me, using the Tower Tycoon Palmer overworld sprite from Nintendo's Pokemon Diamond/Pearl as a reference: https://www.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/pokemondiamondpearl/sheet/6934/. The design is based on a certainly blonde haired, sheika slate wielding, amnesic Hyrulian boy. That�s right. (Please don�t sue me Nintendo, I have too much to live for.)
* Companion sprites were custom drawn by me, using the female Ace Trainer overworld sprite from Pokemon Diamond/Pearl as a reference: https://www.spriters-resource.com/ds_dsi/pokemondiamondpearl/sheet/6931/
